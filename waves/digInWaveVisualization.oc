\outcome {dentify whether the wave travels in the positive or negative direction from the equation of a wave. Describe how signal flows on a transmission line. Describe forward and reflected wave on a transmission line. Sketch forward and reflected wave as a function of distance, and explain how the graph changes as time passes.}
