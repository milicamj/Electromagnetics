\outcome {Explain why is the impedance matching needed How real power changes from the input to the output of a lossless transmission line. Explain how maximum available power from the generator affects power on the transmission line. Explain how minimum reflection from the generator affects power on a transmission line. Explain how minimum reflection from the load affects power on a transmission line.}
