\outcome {Read normalized impedance and reflection coefficient on the Smith Chart given a random point on the Smith Chart. Given impedance, find the normalized position of the impedance on the Smith Chart. Describe the reason for introducing admittance. Write the impedance and admittance of an inductor and capacitor. Explain why is the susceptance of an inductor negative and reactance is positive. Explain why is the admittance Smith Chart rotated 180 degrees. Distinguish between load impedance and normalized load impedance. Describe impedances on the Smith Chart as normalized impedances.Given impedance, read admittance on combo Y/Z chart. Given a random point on Y/Z chart, find admittance, impedance and the reflection coefficient.}
