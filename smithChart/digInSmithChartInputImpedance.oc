\outcome {Calculate the input impedance and input reflection coefficient on Smith Chart if the load impedance or load reflection coefficient are known, and vice-versa. Describe input reflection coefficient in terms of load reflection coefficient. Use Smith Chart to find input reflection coefficient in a typical transmission-line problem.}
