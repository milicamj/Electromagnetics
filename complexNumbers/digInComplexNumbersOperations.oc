\outcome {Describe which coordinate system to use when adding/subtracting and which one when multiplying/dividing two complex numbers. Apply complex numbers to solve a circuit element's impedance if the phasor of current through and voltage on it is known. Apply complex numbers to solve for voltage on a circuit element if phasor of current and impedance are known. Apply complex conjugate operation to a complex number in rectangular and polar coordinates. Derive magnitude of a complex number from a complex number and complex conjugate of the same number.}
